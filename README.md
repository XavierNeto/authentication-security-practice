# authentication-security-practice
I'm learning and practicing Authentication &amp; Security doing this project.
I'm using the following Node modules:
- express
- body-parser
- ejs
- mongoose
- dotenv
- bcrypt

I was using mongoose-encryption and MD5 before, but now I am using bcrypt to salting and hashing.
