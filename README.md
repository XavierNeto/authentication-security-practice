# authentication-security-practice
I'm learning and practicing Authentication &amp; Security doing this project.
I'm using the following Node modules:
- express
- express-session
- body-parser
- ejs
- mongoose
- mongoose-findorcreate
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- passport
- passport-google-oauth20
- passport-local
- passport-local-mongoose

I was using mongoose-encryption and MD5 before, then I was using bcrypt to salting and hashing.
But now I learned and practiced OAuth 2.0, to implement sign in with Google.
